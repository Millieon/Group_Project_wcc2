                Millieon: I've heard that the new Taiwanese government is not much liked, is that true?
            </p>

            <p1 class="taiwanese">
                Wei: Personally, I give the current government a positive evaluation, especially because of their diplomatic performance, they have won the support of many international friends for Taiwan in recent years. However, Some Taiwanese’s political stance are more pro-China or anti-Taiwan independence, they may not like Tsai Ing-wen too much.
 
            </p1>

            <p class="chinese">
                Millieon: How do you feel about what's going on in HK?
            </p>
            <p1 class="taiwanese">
                Wei: For me it’s like an example of what will happen if Taiwan is ruled by the Chinese Communist Party, under the “One country, two systems” policy. I admire the unity and courage of Hongkongers. There are also some people in Taiwan who wish to be ruled by the Chinese Communist Party. I hope that after seeing the example of Hong Kong, they will seriously reconsider their own ideas.

            </p1>

            <p class="chinese">
                Millieon: Are you afraid of the forced reunion? If China is starting a war with Taiwan any time soon?
            </p>

            <p1 class="taiwanese">
                Wei: Taiwanese have been living in this shadow and uncertainty all their lives, and many people have even become paralyzed or lost their vigilance. Personally, I support the Tsai Ing-wen government's current policy of strengthening national defense, but at the same time, I also know that China's force cannot be taken lightly. I think it is natural to feel afraid, but we will do anything to protect our way of life, seek international support, and talk to Chinese people to understand each other. I believe peace is the only way for humans.

            </p1>

            <p class="chinese">
                Millieon: What do you think that most Taiwanese celebrities will go to China for their career so they will abide by the Chinese political ideology?
            </p>
            <p1 class="taiwanese">
                Wei: I understand and respect their choices. However, In recent years, some young Taiwanese music creators are working hard to open up markets outside of China. For example, Fire EX. is developing their market in Japan;Sunset Rollercoaster is expanding into European and American markets. This idea is also more popular with young audiences.
            </p1>

            <p class="chinese">
                Millieon: Do you think that Taiwan's economy heavily rely on China? If so, how do you feel about it?
            </p>
            <p1 class="taiwanese">
                Wei: I do think so. After all, China is one of the most important economies in the world. In my opinion, in the relationship between Taiwan and China, there was space for ambiguity in political statements. However, in recent years, this ambiguity space has become smaller and smaller, causing many Taiwanese businessmen dealing with China to withdraw from the Chinese market and develop other international options. I don't think that sacrificing political and ideological freedom for economic benefits is a sustainable choice. I sincerely hope that one day there will be free and equal dialogue and cooperation between China and Taiwan. 
            </p1>

            <p class="chinese">
                Millieon: Do you think that some Chinese are aggressive on Taiwanese who are pro "Taiwanese independence"?
            </p>
            <p1 class="taiwanese">
                Wei: Obviously yes. But I can totally understand the reaction based on the information they might have received. On the contrary, Some Taiwanese might be aggressive towards the Chinese as well.  
            </p1>

            <p class="chinese">
                Millieon: Do you think that a lot of Taiwanese are pretty indifferent of politics?
            </p>
            <p1 class="taiwanese">
                Wei: I can probably say half and half? Taking my circle of friends as an example, half of them do not pay attention to political issues, while the other half often discuss and participate in social movements.

                In my parents' generation, there were also many people who had hoped for politics but experienced disappointment and became indifferent ever since.
                
            </p1>

            <p class="chinese">
                Millieon: How would you feel and react if someone knows that you are Taiwanese and they will still call you Chinese?
            
            </p>
            <p1 class="taiwanese">
                Wei: It depends on their attitude. Some people just don't understand the difference and have no malice. I'll try to explain it to them. But if it's malicious and intentional, I'm a little offended. I will explain to them and ask respect for my national identity.

                There are some historical and political realities that we cannot change, but I think everyone has the freedom to identify themselves.
