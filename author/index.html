                Millieon: I've heard that the new Taiwanese government is not much liked, is that true?
            </p>

            <p1 class="Wei">
                Wei: Personally, I give the current government a positive evaluation, especially because of their diplomatic performance, they have won the support of many international friends for Taiwan in recent years. However, Some Taiwanese’s political stance are more pro-China or anti-Taiwan independence, they may not like Tsai Ing-wen too much.

                Millieon: How do you feel about what's going on in HK?
            </p>
            <p1 class="Wei">
                Wei: For me it’s like an example of what will happen if Taiwan is ruled by the Chinese Communist Party, under the “One country, two systems” policy. I admire the unity and courage of Hongkongers. There are also some people in Taiwan who wish to be ruled by the Chinese Communist Party. I hope that after seeing the example of Hong Kong, they will seriously reconsider their own ideas.

            <p class="Millieon">
                Millieon: Are you afraid of the forced reunion? If China is starting a war with Taiwan any time soon?
            </p>

            <p1 class="Wei">
                Wei: Taiwanese have been living in this shadow and uncertainty all their lives, and many people have even become paralyzed or lost their vigilance. Personally, I support the Tsai Ing-wen government's current policy of strengthening national defense, but at the same time, I also know that China's force cannot be taken lightly. I think it is natural to feel afraid, but we will do anything to protect our way of life, seek international support, and talk to Chinese people to understand each other. I believe peace is the only way for humans.
