                Wei: Do you think the experience of studying abroad will bring about changes in the values or political thinking of Chinese international students? Is there any pressure to try to stop such changes, from the government or from family and friends?
            </p>

            <p1 class="Millieon">
                Millieon: I think most likely it would help, however, I think people have a choice to choose what and how to believe in and think, so I think a lot of people would actually stay in their own bubbles. The pressure you've mentioned might come from family or friends, because you might get confronted because of the political positions.

            <p class="Wei">
                Wei: For you or most Chinese people, what do you think when you hear someone calling themselves "Taiwanese"?

            </p>
            <p1 class="Millieon">
                Millieon: Speaking for myself, I would love to hear people call themselves Taiwanese, in fact, they are free to call themselves whatever they want; I call my Taiwanese friends Taiwanese as well, because standing from my own political position, I can't call Taiwanese Chinese; However, I can't speak for "most" Chinese people and I do know some will get offended by it.

                Wei: What is the thing you are most proud of in contemporary China?

                Wei: Are there any common misconceptions about China by Taiwanese, or foreigners?
